📖 Project Overview

The PalindromeChecker App is a console-based Java application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., madam, racecar).

This project focuses on strengthening core Java fundamentals and understanding basic data structures.

🎯 Objective

Design and implement a Java console application.

Validate whether a given string is a palindrome.

Strengthen understanding of:

Java syntax

String handling

Conditional statements

User input handling

🔄 Project Flow

Program starts.

main() method is executed.

User is prompted to enter a string.

The string is reversed.

The original string is compared with the reversed string.

If both are equal → It is a palindrome.

Otherwise → It is not a palindrome.

Result is displayed on the console.

Program exits.
